# Test Epic: Task Priority Color Coding

## Epic Overview
Add visual color coding to tasks based on their priority level to improve user experience and task visibility.

## Epic Goals
- Improve task visibility through color coding
- Help users quickly identify high-priority tasks
- Maintain consistency with existing design system
- Ensure accessibility compliance

## Success Criteria
- Tasks display with appropriate colors based on priority
- Colors are accessible and meet WCAG guidelines
- Feature works in all user states (authenticated, demo, unauthenticated)
- No performance impact on task loading
- Colors are consistent across all task displays

## Agent Assignments

### Frontend Agent
**Responsibilities:**
- Implement color coding in TaskCard component
- Update task list displays to show priority colors
- Ensure responsive design maintains color visibility
- Add color accessibility features

**Deliverables:**
- Updated TaskCard component with priority colors
- Color utility functions for priority mapping
- Accessibility-compliant color scheme
- Mobile-responsive color implementation

**Dependencies:**
- Existing task priority system
- Current TaskCard component structure

### Integration Agent
**Responsibilities:**
- Coordinate color scheme with design system
- Ensure consistency across all task displays
- Test color visibility in different contexts
- Validate accessibility compliance

**Deliverables:**
- Color scheme integration plan
- Accessibility validation report
- Cross-component consistency check
- User experience testing results

**Dependencies:**
- Frontend color implementation
- Design system guidelines

## Timeline
- **Day 1**: Planning and color scheme design
- **Day 2**: Frontend implementation
- **Day 3**: Integration and testing
- **Day 4**: Accessibility validation and deployment

## Risk Mitigation
- **Accessibility**: Use WCAG-compliant color combinations
- **Performance**: Minimal CSS changes, no JavaScript overhead
- **Consistency**: Follow existing design patterns
- **Testing**: Test across all user states and devices

## Communication Plan
- **Daily**: Progress updates in `.claude/context/`
- **Blockers**: Immediate notification to all agents
- **Decisions**: Document color choices and rationale

## Priority Color Mapping
- **High Priority**: Red (#ef4444)
- **Medium Priority**: Yellow (#f59e0b) 
- **Low Priority**: Green (#10b981)
- **No Priority**: Gray (#6b7280)

## Testing Requirements
- Test in light and dark themes (if applicable)
- Verify color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards
- Test on mobile devices for color visibility
- Validate in demo mode and authenticated mode
