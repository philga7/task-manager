# Test Epic Progress Tracking

## Epic: Task Priority Color Coding
**Status**: In Progress  
**Start Date**: August 27, 2025  
**Learning Objective**: Master Claude Code PM workflow

## Current Phase: Planning & Setup

### Completed Steps
- ✅ Created test epic definition
- ✅ Defined agent assignments
- ✅ Set success criteria
- ✅ Established timeline
- ✅ Created priority color utility functions
- ✅ Updated TaskCard component with priority colors
- ✅ Implemented accessibility-compliant color scheme

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Create GitHub issues from epic (simulated)
2. ✅ Test /pm:issue-start command (implemented priority colors)
3. Practice basic workflow commands
4. Document lessons learned

## Learning Notes

### What We're Learning
- How to structure an epic for Claude Code PM
- Agent assignment and responsibility definition
- Success criteria and timeline planning
- Risk mitigation strategies

### Key Concepts
- **Epic**: A large feature broken down into manageable tasks
- **Agent Assignment**: Defining who does what work
- **Dependencies**: Understanding what needs to be done first
- **Success Criteria**: Clear goals for completion

## Questions for Learning
- How do we convert this epic to GitHub issues?
- What commands do we use to start work on issues?
- How do agents coordinate their work?
- What happens when there are blockers?

## Lessons Learned

### Epic Structure Best Practices
- **Clear Goals**: Define specific, measurable objectives
- **Agent Assignments**: Clearly specify who does what work
- **Dependencies**: Identify what needs to be done first
- **Success Criteria**: Define clear completion standards
- **Timeline**: Set realistic timeframes for each phase

### Issue Creation Patterns
- **Single Responsibility**: Each issue should have one clear purpose
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define specific, testable requirements
- **Technical Details**: Include file paths, function names, and implementation notes
- **Dependencies**: List what needs to be completed first
- **Labels**: Use consistent labeling for categorization

### Workflow Understanding
- **Epic → Issues**: Large features are broken down into manageable tasks
- **Agent Coordination**: Different agents work on different aspects simultaneously
- **Dependency Management**: Some work must be completed before others can start
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing and validation are built into the process
